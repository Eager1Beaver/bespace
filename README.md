# Investigating Brainâ€“Eye Communication Subspaces During Sleep

## Project Overview

This project explores the coordination between brain and eye activity during different sleep stages using EEG and EOG signals. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is used to extract low-dimensional shared subspaces, offering insights into how EEGâ€“EOG coupling varies across Wake, N1, N2, N3, and REM stages.

Key contributions:
- Time-resolved and static CCA analysis of EEGâ€“EOG coupling.
- Entropy and trajectory analysis of canonical correlation dynamics.
- Visualizations summarizing sleep-stage specific brainâ€“eye interactions.

The study uses the publicly available **APPLES dataset** from the [National Sleep Research Resource](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/apples).

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Option 1: Using `requirements.txt`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eager1Beaver/bespace.git
cd bespace

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: (optional) Using `pyproject.toml`
```bash
pip install .
```

---

## Configuration

All pipeline behavior is controlled from:
```
src/config/config.yaml
```

Edit the YAML file to enable or disable pipeline steps:
```yaml
run_params:
  run_static_cca: true
  run_time_resolved_cca: true
  run_static_analysis: true
  run_time_resolved_analysis: true
  generate_figures: true
```

You can also set:
- EEG and EOG channel names
- Input/output directories
- Window and step sizes for time-resolved CCA

---

## Usage

To run the full pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

Outputs will be saved to the paths defined in your config. This includes:
- Canonical correlation values
- Time-resolved trajectories and entropy stats
- Publication-ready visualizations

---

## Dataset

This project uses data from the **APPLES** study:
> The Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study (APPLES) is a clinical trial available from NSRR.
